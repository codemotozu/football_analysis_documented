# Import the PlayerBallAssigner class from the current package (indicated by the dot '.').
# This class is likely responsible for assigning the ball possession to players based on their positions
# or some other criteria in the context of tracking and analysis.
# Importing from a relative path ensures the code is modular and works within the project structure.
